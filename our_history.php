                <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay=".2s">As a priority, SWISSCANONICA wants to meet customer needs with high-end quality products. Its success and sustainability is due to its capability to work with the one and only objective of best quality. Through its products and services, the group seeks to reflect the world-renowned Swiss quality. As a result, the group follows accurate guidelines and standards and performs internal audit on a regular basis in order to improve continuously the quality of its products and services.<br>
 
                These three milestones interact generating dynamism of quality that has led the company since its creation. <br>

                Moreover, in 2013, Bureau VERITAS certified Canonica Management SA (the management support company for all companies of the SWISSCANONICA Group) for its quality management system according to the ISO 2008: 9001 standard. This certification has been renewed on the 10th of January 2016 until September 2018. <br>
                The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) aims at developing and publishing international standards in the industrial and commercial sectors called ISO standards. This framework aims at improving the performances of the companies towards their different targets (customers, staff, shareholders, suppliers and partners).<br>

                This certification is implemented on a daily basis and highlights the professional and committed approach of SWISSCANONICA group. Today, its priority is to meet the standards in order to move forward in a positive and efficient way in the daily operations management.<br>
                SWISSCANONICA performs successfully thanks to these values which it has referred to consistently since 1948.
